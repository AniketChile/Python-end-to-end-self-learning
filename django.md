For a full stack interview covering **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Python, and Django** within 45 minutes to 1 hour, mastering Django alone with the basic questions mentioned is a good start but **not sufficient** on its own.

***

### What to Focus on for Efficient Preparation:

#### 1. **Django:**
- Understand core concepts (models, views, templates, URLs).
- Basic CRUD operations and REST APIs.
- How frontend integrates with Django (templates or APIs).
- Familiarity with static and media files, forms, and authentication basics.

#### 2. **Python:**
- Core syntax and data structures (lists, dicts, sets).
- Functions, OOP basics.
- Exception handling and file operations.
- Familiarity with modules and libraries.

#### 3. **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS):**
- Semantic HTML and CSS styling basics.
- Responsive design concepts.
- JavaScript fundamentals (dom manipulation, event handling).
- ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, promises).

#### 4. **React.js and Next.js:**
- Component-based architecture and JSX.
- State and props management.
- Event handling and lifecycle methods/hooks.
- Routing in Next.js and server-side rendering basics.
- Understand how React interacts with backend via APIs.

### Time Management Tips for Interview:

- Do not over-focus on advanced Django features if time is limited.
- Be comfortable explaining your projects or basic examples quickly.
- Practice coding small snippets in Python and React.
- Prepare to discuss how frontend and backend communicate (REST APIs, AJAX).
- Prepare answers to common full-stack interview questions combining frontend and backend.

### Summary

- The Django questions you prepared cover foundational understanding â€” **good for a Django portion** of the interview.
- But since it is a full stack interview, allocate time to refresh and practice **all other technologies mentioned**.
- Focus on **core concepts, practical coding skills, and clear explanations** rather than deep dives into niche topics.
- Practice mock interviews or timed coding questions if possible.
