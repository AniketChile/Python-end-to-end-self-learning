in python the objects are store in the private heap memory where the variable pointing to that object is store in the stack memory the object allocation in the memory by creating the space is done by the python memory manager. also when a variable is pointing to object in side the heap memory the nternal refrence count increase and when another variable points to the same object that time refernce count increase and wile the element is deleted to reassign the refernce count decreases and then the garbage collector clear the memory which runs periodically


# In Python, objects are stored in the private heap memory managed by the Python memory manager. When a variable is created, it points to an object in the heap; this pointer (reference) is stored in the stack memory. The Python memory manager handles allocation of space for objects in the heap.Whenever a variable points to an object, Python increases the object's internal reference count. If another variable references the same object, the count increases again. When a variable is deleted or reassigned, the reference count decreases. If the reference count drops to zero, meaning no variables point to the object, Pythonâ€™s garbage collector will periodically run and free that memory.
